Beef is safe for dogs — but there's a catch 🥩

🟡 High fat = pancreatitis risk if overfed
→ Lean cuts only, trim visible fat
→ MUST be fully cooked
→ No seasoning, onion, or garlic
→ Watch portion sizes carefully

Max serving: small dogs 15~20g, 2-3x per week

우리 햇살이도 소고기는 특별한 날에만.
너무 좋아해서 조절이 필요해요 🐾
