You've definitely googled "can my dog eat kidney beans" at least once 🫘

Yes — cooked kidney beans are safe for dogs.
→ High in protein & fiber
→ MUST be fully cooked (raw = toxic)
→ Plain only, no seasoning
→ Mash or blend for easier digestion

Serving: small dogs 1-2 beans, medium 3-5, large 5-8

⚠️ 강낭콩은 반드시 푹 익혀서 줘야 해요.
생으로 주면 독이에요 🐾
