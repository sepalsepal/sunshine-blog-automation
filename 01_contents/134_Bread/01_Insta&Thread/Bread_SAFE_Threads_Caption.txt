You've definitely googled "can my dog eat bread" at least once 🍞

Yes — plain bread is safe for dogs.
→ Small amounts only, not nutritious
→ Plain white or wheat bread only
→ NO raisins, garlic, or xylitol
→ No raw dough (can expand in stomach)

Serving: small piece as occasional treat

식빵은 햇살이한테 조금씩만 줘요.
건포도 빵은 절대 안 돼요 🐾
