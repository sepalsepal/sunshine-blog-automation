You've definitely googled "can my dog eat chicken skewer" at least once 🍗

Plain grilled chicken is safe — but typical skewers are not.
→ Street food has sauce = sugar, garlic
→ Remove from wooden stick (splinters)
→ Plain unseasoned chicken only
→ No charred parts

Serving: small dogs 15g, medium 30g, large 50g (plain only)

햇살이한테는 양념 없는 닭가슴살로 따로 줘요 🐾
