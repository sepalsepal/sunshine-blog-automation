You've definitely googled "can my dog eat napa cabbage" at least once 🥬

Yes — napa cabbage (배추) is safe for dogs.
→ High water content, hydrating
→ Low calorie, great for treats
→ Cook lightly for easier digestion
→ Too much can cause gas

Serving: small dogs 15-20g, medium 30-50g, large 50-80g

배추 살짝 익혀서 주면 햇살이가 잘 먹어요 🐾
