🚫 Chocolate can kill your dog. The darker, the deadlier.

Contains theobromine — dogs can't metabolize it.
→ Dark chocolate = most dangerous
→ Symptoms: vomiting, seizures, heart issues
→ Even small amounts can be toxic
→ Baking chocolate = highest risk

If your dog ate chocolate → vet IMMEDIATELY
Note the TYPE and AMOUNT eaten.

11년째 키우면서 초콜릿은 높은 곳에 보관해요.
발렌타인데이에 특히 조심 🐾
