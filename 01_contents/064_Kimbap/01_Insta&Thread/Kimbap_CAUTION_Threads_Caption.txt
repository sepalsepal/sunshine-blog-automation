Kimbap is safe for dogs — but there's a catch 🍙

🟡 May contain harmful ingredients
→ Check for pickled radish (high sodium)
→ Avoid if contains ham/processed meat
→ Sesame oil = high fat
→ Plain rice + seaweed only is safest

Max serving: 1 piece, occasionally

우리 햇살이도 김밥은 속 빼고 밥이랑 김만.
그게 제일 안전해요 🐾
