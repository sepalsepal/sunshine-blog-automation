🚫 Avocado can seriously harm your dog. Not "maybe." Definitely.

There is NO safe amount. Here's why:
→ cardiac toxicity
→ pancreatitis risk
→ Symptoms may appear hours or days later

If your dog ate avocado:
→ Note the amount and time
→ Contact your vet immediately
→ Do NOT induce vomiting without vet guidance

11년째 키우면서 아보카도만큼은 철저하게 관리해요.
몰랐다면 괜찮아요. 지금 알았으니까요 🐾
