Cheese is safe for dogs — but there's a catch 🧀

🟡 Watch for lactose intolerance
→ Many dogs can't digest dairy well
→ Low-lactose cheese is better (cheddar, swiss)
→ Small amounts only as treats
→ Skip if your dog gets gassy or has diarrhea

Max serving: small piece, occasionally

우리 햇살이는 치즈 조금씩만 줘요.
많이 주면 배탈 나요 🐾
