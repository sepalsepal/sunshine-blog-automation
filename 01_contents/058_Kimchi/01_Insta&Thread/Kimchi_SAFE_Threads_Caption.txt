You've definitely googled "can my dog eat kimchi" at least once 🥬

Plain cabbage from kimchi is safe — BUT with caution.
→ High sodium = not for regular feeding
→ Spices may upset stomach
→ Rinse off seasoning before serving
→ Plain, unseasoned cabbage is better

Serving: small dogs 5g, medium 10g, large 15g (rarely)

햇살이는 김치보다 그냥 배추를 더 좋아해요 🐾
