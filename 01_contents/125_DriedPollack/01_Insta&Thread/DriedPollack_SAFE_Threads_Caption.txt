You've definitely googled "can my dog eat dried pollack" at least once 🐟

Yes — dried pollack (황태) is safe for dogs.
→ High protein, low fat
→ Rich in omega-3
→ Already dried = ready to serve
→ Tear into small pieces

Serving: small dogs 5-10g, medium 15-20g, large 25-30g

황태는 햇살이 최애 간식이에요.
냄새만 맡아도 꼬리 흔들어요 🐾
