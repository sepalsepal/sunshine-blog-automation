You've definitely googled "can my dog eat fried chicken" at least once 🍗

Technically safe, but NOT recommended.
→ High fat = pancreatitis risk
→ Seasoning may contain garlic/onion
→ Bones are choking hazard
→ Plain boiled chicken is much better

If giving: meat only, no skin, no bones, tiny amount

햇살이가 아무리 애원해도, 튀긴 건 안 줘요.
그 대신 삶은 닭가슴살로 🐾
