You've definitely googled "can my dog eat chicken" at least once 🍗

Yes — chicken is safe for dogs.
→ High protein, great for muscle
→ MUST be fully cooked (no raw)
→ Remove all bones (choking hazard)
→ No skin, no seasoning

Serving: small dogs 15~20g, medium 30~50g, large 60~80g

햇살이는 닭고기 익는 냄새에 주방으로 달려와요 🐾
