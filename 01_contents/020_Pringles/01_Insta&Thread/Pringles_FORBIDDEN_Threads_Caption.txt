🚫 Pringles can harm your dog. Seriously.

There is NO safe amount. Here's why:
→ High sodium causes dehydration & kidney stress
→ Onion/garlic powder in many flavors (TOXIC)
→ Artificial additives upset digestive system
→ Fat content can trigger pancreatitis

If your dog ate Pringles:
→ Monitor for vomiting, lethargy, excessive thirst
→ Contact vet if symptoms appear

11년째 키우면서 과자만큼은 철저하게 관리해요 🐾
