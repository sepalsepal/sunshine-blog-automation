Papaya is safe for dogs — but there's a catch 🧡

🟡 High sugar + digestive enzymes can upset stomach
→ Remove all seeds (contain traces of cyanide)
→ Peel the skin completely
→ Ripe fruit only, no unripe papaya
→ Small portions to avoid diarrhea

Max serving: 15-20g for small dogs, 2-3x per week

햇살이는 열대과일 향에 코를 킁킁 🐾
