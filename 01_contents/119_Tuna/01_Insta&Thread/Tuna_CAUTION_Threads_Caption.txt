Tuna is safe for dogs — but there's a catch 🐟

🟡 Mercury content is a concern
→ Small amounts only, not regularly
→ Fresh is better than canned
→ If canned, choose water-packed
→ No added salt or seasonings

Max serving: small piece, occasionally (1-2x per month)

우리 햇살이도 참치는 가끔씩만 줘요.
수은 때문에 자주 주면 안 돼요 🐾
