🚫 Bulgogi can seriously harm your dog. Not "maybe." Definitely.

There is NO safe amount. Here's why:
→ Contains compounds toxic to dogs
→ Symptoms may appear hours or days later
→ Even small amounts can be dangerous

If your dog ate bulgogi:
→ Note the amount and time
→ Contact your vet immediately

11년째 키우면서 불고기만큼은 철저하게 관리해요.
몰랐다면 괜찮아요. 지금 알았으니까요 🐾
