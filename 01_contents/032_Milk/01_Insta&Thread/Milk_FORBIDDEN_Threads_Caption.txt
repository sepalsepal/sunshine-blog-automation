🚫 Milk is not recommended for dogs. Here's why.

Most dogs are lactose intolerant.
→ Can't digest lactose properly
→ Causes diarrhea, vomiting, gas
→ Even small amounts cause issues
→ Puppies lose lactase after weaning

If your dog drank milk:
→ Monitor for digestive upset
→ Provide plenty of water

11년째 키우면서 우유는 주지 않아요.
강아지 전용 우유가 따로 있으니까요 🐾
