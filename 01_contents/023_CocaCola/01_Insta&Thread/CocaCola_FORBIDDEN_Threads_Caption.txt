🚫 Coca-Cola can seriously harm your dog. Not "maybe." Definitely.

There is NO safe amount. Here's why:
→ Caffeine is toxic to dogs (stimulant overdose)
→ High sugar causes obesity & diabetes
→ Phosphoric acid damages teeth & bones
→ Symptoms: restlessness, rapid breathing, vomiting

If your dog drank Coca-Cola:
→ Note the amount and time
→ Contact your vet immediately

11년째 키우면서 탄산음료만큼은 철저하게 관리해요.
몰랐다면 괜찮아요. 지금 알았으니까요 🐾
