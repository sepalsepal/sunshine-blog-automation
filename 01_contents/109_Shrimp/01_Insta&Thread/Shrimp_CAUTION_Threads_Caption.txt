Shrimp is safe for dogs — but there's a catch 🦐

🟡 Preparation is important
→ Always cook thoroughly (no raw)
→ Remove shell, head, and tail
→ Some dogs have shellfish allergies
→ High in cholesterol, so moderate only

Max serving: 1-2 shrimp, occasionally

우리 햇살이도 새우는 껍질 벗겨서 조금만 줘요.
알레르기 있을 수 있어서요 🐾
