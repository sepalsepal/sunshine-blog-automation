Banana milk is safe for dogs — but there's a catch 🍌

🟡 Contains lactose + added sugar
→ Most dogs are lactose intolerant
→ High sugar = weight gain
→ Plain banana is better alternative
→ Only as rare treat, tiny amounts

Max serving: 10~15ml, once a week max

우리 햇살이도 바나나우유는 정말 가끔만.
그냥 바나나가 더 좋아요 🐾
