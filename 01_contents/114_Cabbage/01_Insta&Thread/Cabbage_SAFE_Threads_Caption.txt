You've definitely googled "can my dog eat cabbage" at least once 🥬

Yes — cabbage is safe for dogs.
→ High in fiber, aids digestion
→ Low calorie, great for weight management
→ Cook lightly for easier digestion
→ Too much can cause gas

Serving: small dogs 15-20g, medium 30-50g, large 50-80g

햇살이는 양배추 살짝 익혀서 줘요.
많이 주면 방귀가... 🐾
