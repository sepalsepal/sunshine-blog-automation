You've definitely googled "can my dog have coconut oil" at least once 🥥

Yes — coconut oil is safe for dogs.
→ Good for skin & coat health
→ Contains healthy MCT fats
→ Add small amount to food
→ Too much = diarrhea

Serving: 1/4 tsp for small dogs, 1 tsp for large dogs

코코넛오일 사료에 조금 섞어주면
햇살이 털이 윤기나요 🐾
